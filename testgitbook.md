: A note from GitHub regarding your account activity 
Hi there, 
My name is Morgan and I&apos;m writing on behalf of GitHub Support. 
It seems you may be using automated measures to follow thousands of users. While we certainly encourage using 
the follow feature to participate in the GitHub community, many of our users equate this type of behavior with 
spam, as it seems to only serve the purpose of drawing unsolicited attention to your GitHub profile. This becomes 
an unnecessary distraction for our community members. 
At this time, we would ask that you remove any automated follows and that you no longer use these mass follow 
techniques. Keep in mind that we do consider this spammy behavior, and we do have the option of taking further 
action in that regard. We&apos;d rather not, of course, as we hope for your cooperation! 
Please let us know if you have any questions. 
Thanks, 
GitHub Support ")
